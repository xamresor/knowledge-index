# Changelog

All notable changes to **knowledge-index** are recorded here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
versioning is [SemVer](https://semver.org/) with `0.x` semantics: **breaking changes bump the minor**
until the MCP tool contract stabilises at `1.0.0`.

The single source of truth for the current version is the `VERSION` file. It is reported by
`bin/kb --version` and by the MCP server in `initialize` → `serverInfo.version`.

> **Not the same axis:** a consumer may carry its own component-level compatibility field (e.g. a
> plugin/cartridge manifest version). Those numbers and this repo's version are independent and will
> diverge — don't sync them.

## [Unreleased]

Planned, in the order decided 2026-07-25:

- **0.3.0** — write path: `docs_put` / `POST` accepting a fragment with a target anchor and
  **auto-filled provenance** (rejects documents without it); scopes as one collection per ownership
  boundary.
- **0.4.0** — query layer: stopword handling, alias dictionary (query-time synonym expansion),
  routing between the lexical and vector legs by question shape.
- **0.5.0** — remote canon: the index lives on a server, local agents reach it over MCP/SSH.
- **1.0.0** — when the MCP tool contract stops changing *and* a second independent consumer exists.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-25

First tagged release. State of the tool as it is actually used in two private deployments (a
personal markdown wiki and a codebase indexing itself), not a rewrite.

### Added
- **MCP server** `bin/kb-mcp` (stdio, zero Python dependencies) exposing six tools:
  `graph_query`, `graph_path`, `graph_explain`, `graph_affected`, `docs_search`, `docs_get`.
- **Cross-repo graph edges**: frontend call sites matched to backend controllers
  (`calls` → `serves`), incl. Next/React and Nuxt/ofetch `$api()` matchers, tolerant of a Laravel
  `api/` prefix.
- **`confidence` on edges** — `EXTRACTED | INFERRED | AMBIGUOUS | DERIVED`, so regex-derived edges
  no longer masquerade as AST facts; rendered dotted in the visualisation.
- **rationale nodes** — `NOTE`/`WHY`/`HACK`/`SECURITY`/`RATIONALE` comments become `rationale`
  nodes with `explains` edges (`bin/link_rationale.py`, capped at 8 per file).
- **Doc half**: aggregated docs staged into one qmd collection (`kb` by default, `KB_COLLECTION`
  to override) with a selectable qmd backend (`bin/kb qmd-backend`).
- **Namespace labelling** and clustered graph rendering (`bin/label_namespaces.py`,
  `bin/render_viz.py`).
- **`bin/kb --version`** — prints the repo version plus the resolved `graphify` and `qmd` versions.
- Unit tests for the HTTP matcher, including `{id?}` query-splitting in `norm_path`.

### Changed
- Repository renamed `knowledge-base` → `knowledge-index` (2026-07-05). Old name still appears in
  historical notes; there is no compatibility shim.
- MCP `serverInfo.version` now reports the real version from `VERSION` (it previously reported a
  hardcoded `1.0`, which overstated stability).

### Requirements
- **`graphify >= 0.9.25`** (`Graphify-Labs/graphify`) — the code-graph half.
- **`qmd`** (verified with 2.5.3) — the doc-search half; embeddings run on-device.
- `python3`, `bash`. All generated artefacts (`graphify-out/`, `repos/`, `.docs/`,
  `kb.projects.toml`) are gitignored — a checkout builds them, it does not carry them.

### Known limits
- `qmd` filters by **collection only**; an arbitrary doc-id pre-filter is not supported, so
  fine-grained scoping needs one collection per scope (or an upstream patch).
- The graph covers the languages `graphify` parses; Elixir projects are out of scope.

## [0.1.0] — untagged (pre-2026-07-05)

Retroactive label for the pre-MCP era: a single-repo graphify wrapper under the old name
`knowledge-base`. No tag exists for it; recorded here so the numbering means something.
